## 🚀 Phase 6.1 Implementation & Upgrade Path

### Strategic Build Restoration (December 2024)
- **Compromise-first, enhance-later:** Temporarily simplified complex features (TensorFlow.js, manifestor-driven config, advanced logging) to restore build stability.
- **Permanent Lean improvements:** Modernized Next.js config, security headers, and maintainable codebase.
- **Runtime safety:** Fallback detection and emergency handling implemented in ComputerVisionEngine.
- **Upgrade tracking:** All planned feature restorations and enhancements are tracked in [`TODO.upgrade.md`](../TODO.upgrade.md).
- **Strategic documentation:** BEFORE vs AFTER analysis, change classification, and versioning in [`PHASE6_BUILD_RESTORATION_STRATEGY.md`](../PHASE6_BUILD_RESTORATION_STRATEGY.md).
- **Versioning:** Tagged `v1.0.0-stable` as the baseline for all future upgrades.

### Lean Architecture Principles in Action
- **Fix first, optimize later:** Build stability is always the first priority.
- **Controlled phasing:** All compromises are tracked and reversible, with a clear upgrade path.
- **No technical debt:** Every temporary downgrade is documented and scheduled for restoration.
- **Runtime guards:** Fallbacks and monitoring ensure production safety.
- **Transparent versioning:** Each phase is tagged and documented for auditability.

### Next Steps
- **Phase 6.2:** Restore advanced features incrementally, always maintaining a working build.
- **Continuous improvement:** Each upgrade is benchmarked against the v1.0.0-stable baseline.
