# AI-BOS Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation

## Overview

The AI-BOS Engine now includes a **production-grade Circuit Breaker pattern** that provides enterprise-level reliability, cost optimization, and intelligent provider fallback. This implementation follows industry best practices used by Netflix, Amazon, and other leading platforms.

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, requests flow through
- **OPEN**: Provider is failing, requests are blocked
- **HALF_OPEN**: Testing if provider has recovered
- **Automatic Recovery**: Circuits automatically close when providers become healthy

### 2. **Intelligent Provider Fallback**
- **Configurable Fallback Chain**: `['openai', 'anthropic', 'local']`
- **Health-Based Selection**: Only healthy providers are used
- **Cost Optimization**: Cheaper providers for non-critical requests
- **Performance-Based Routing**: Fastest providers for time-sensitive requests

### 3. **Provider Health Monitoring**
- **Success/Failure Tracking**: Real-time metrics per provider
- **Response Time Monitoring**: Average response times
- **Cost Tracking**: Per-request and total costs
- **Health Status**: Automatic health determination (80% success rate threshold)

### 4. **Graceful Degradation**
- **Cached Response Fallback**: Return cached responses when all providers are down
- **Degraded Response**: Meaningful error messages instead of complete failure
- **Configurable Behavior**: Enable/disable graceful degradation

## üìä Configuration

### Circuit Breaker Configuration
```typescript
circuitBreaker: {
  failureThreshold: 5,        // Failures before opening circuit
  recoveryTimeout: 60000,     // 1 minute recovery wait
  successThreshold: 3,        // Successes to close circuit
  timeout: 30000             // Request timeout
}
```

### Fallback Chain Configuration
```typescript
fallbackChain: ['openai', 'anthropic', 'local']
```

### Provider Health Thresholds
- **Success Rate**: 80% minimum for healthy status
- **Failure Rate**: 50% triggers circuit breaker
- **Response Time**: Tracked for performance optimization

## üîß Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```typescript
import { aiEngine } from './AIEngine';

// The engine automatically handles circuit breakers and fallback
const response = await aiEngine.process({
  task: 'text-generation',
  prompt: 'Generate a creative story',
  options: {
    provider: 'openai',  // Will fallback to anthropic if openai fails
    model: 'gpt-4'
  }
});
```

### Advanced Configuration
```typescript
const engine = new AIEngine({
  circuitBreaker: {
    failureThreshold: 3,      // More sensitive
    recoveryTimeout: 30000,   // 30 seconds
    successThreshold: 2
  },
  fallbackChain: ['anthropic', 'openai', 'local'], // Different priority
  enableGracefulDegradation: true
});
```

## üìà Monitoring Endpoints

      "total": 3,
      "healthy": 2,
      "unhealthy": 1
    },
    "circuitBreakers": {

        "provider": "openai",
        "successCount": 95,
        "failureCount": 5,
        "totalRequests": 100,
        "averageResponseTime": 1200,
        "circuitBreakerState": "CLOSED",
        "isHealthy": true,
        "costPerRequest": 0.002,
        "totalCost": 0.2
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## üö® Circuit Breaker States

### CLOSED (Normal)
- Requests flow normally to the provider
- Failures are tracked but don't block requests
- Default state for healthy providers

### OPEN (Blocking)
- All requests are immediately rejected
- Prevents cascading failures
- Automatically transitions to HALF_OPEN after recovery timeout

### HALF_OPEN (Testing)
- Limited requests are allowed to test recovery
- Success transitions back to CLOSED
- Failure returns to OPEN
