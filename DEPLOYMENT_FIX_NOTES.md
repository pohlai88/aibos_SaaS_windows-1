# 🚨 Deployment Issue & Fix Notes

## **Issue Encountered**
**Date**: Current deployment  
**Error**: `Module not found: Can't resolve '@aibos/shared'`

### **Root Cause**
The deployment was using a cached/committed version of `AibosShellEnhanced.tsx` that still contained the `@aibos/shared` import, even though we had removed it from the local version.

### **Error Details**
```
./src/components/shell/AibosShellEnhanced.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '@aibos/shared'

Import trace for requested module:
./src/app/page.tsx
```

---

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### **Step 1: Identified the Problem**
- Local files were clean (no @aibos/shared imports)
- Git status showed uncommitted changes
- Deployment was using older committed version

### **Step 2: Committed the Fix**
```bash
git add railway-1/frontend/src/components/shell/AibosShellEnhanced.tsx
git add railway-1/frontend/vercel.json
git commit -m "fix: Remove @aibos/shared import from AibosShellEnhanced component"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 3: Verification**
- ✅ Removed @aibos/shared import from component
- ✅ Updated Vercel configuration
- ✅ Pushed to main branch
- ✅ Ready for next deployment

---

## 📝 **Key Learnings**

### **1. Git State vs Local State**
- Always check `git status` before deployment
- Uncommitted changes won't be deployed
- Local builds may pass while deployment fails

### **2. Import Dependencies**
- Remove all references to non-existent packages
- Check both direct imports and TypeScript config
- Clear build cache when making dependency changes

### **3. Deployment Process**
- Commit changes before deployment
- Verify git state matches local state
- Test build locally before pushing

---

## 🔄 **Next Deployment**

The next deployment should now succeed because:
- ✅ All @aibos/shared imports removed
- ✅ Dependencies properly configured
- ✅ Build process verified locally
- ✅ Changes committed and pushed

---

## 📊 **Status**

**Current State**: ✅ **Fixed and Ready**  
**Next Action**: Monitor deployment success  
**Prevention**: Always commit changes before deployment
